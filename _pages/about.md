I am currently a first-year Graduate student at School of Computer Science and Engineering, Beihang University, advised by [Prof. Deqing Wang](https://scholar.google.com/citations?&user=NrYqxY4AAAAJ). My research area is **Natural Language Processing** and **Machine Learning**, especially interested in **Zero/Few Shot Learning**, **MultiModal Machine Learning**. I am seeking how these techniques can improve the ability of models to process and understand multimodal information.
